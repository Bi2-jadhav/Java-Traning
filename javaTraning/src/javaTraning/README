normal method needs object of class to call 
 static method doesn't need object of class to call 

super.()  calling patent constructor
super.variable calling parent variable ;
kisibhi constructor ki peheli line uska parent class ka constructor hoga
 final class can not be extended
 finally is a block always associated with exception handling or try catch block , always execute when system.exit finally will not excute
 finally purpose : cleanup activity code , deallocation , resourse deallocation code
 serialization , explicitly calling garbeg collector
 finalize()  obejct class method finilize() The finalize() method is a protected method defined in the java.lang.Object class. finalize() is called by the Garbage Collector (GC) just before an object is removed from memory.
 finalize() will get called only one time , finalize() always associated with object 

 heap memory objects are eligible for grabge collector
 scp(string constraints pool) memory object are not eligible for grabge collector because jvm automatically provides reference 

 
 in java if class has a static method it can be called directly using class 
 like thread class has sleep method called thread.sleep();
 if we are using object of that class then the method will not be static like scanner class has nextInt();
